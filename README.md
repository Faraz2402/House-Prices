# House-Prices

Project Description: Ask a home buyer to describe their dream house, and they probably won't begin with the height of the basement ceiling or the proximity to an east-west railroad. But this playground competition's dataset proves that much more influences price negotiations than the number of bedrooms or a white-picket fence.
With 79 explanatory variables describing (almost) every aspect of residential homes in Ames, Iowa, predict the final price of each home.

Responsibility: The goal is to transform all the data into numeric, while preserving as much information from the categorical variables. As I have to predict continuous variable, Linear Regression method has been used while extracting important features from the dataset. The feature extraction method has been used till maximum accuracy was achieved. The data required extensive cleaning as there were missing values and multicollinearity between numerical variables.
